## A Quick Note

If your project is currently only using `TwitchChat` or `TwitchClip` you will need to update this package to the `>2.0.0` version and take into account
the `parent` prop required for these two components. If you haven't updated this package, these components **will stop working after the 10th June of 2020**.

Moreover, after the 10th of June 2020 deadline, all sites that implement these components will need to run in **HTTPS**. Unless Twitch releases an update
on this, this requirement will also apply for local environments. For more information, check out the [Twitch Dev Discussion thread regarding this change](https://discuss.dev.twitch.tv/t/twitch-embedded-player-migration-timeline-update/25588/14?u=moonstar_x).

> **Note**: If `channel`, `collection` and `video` are supplied, only `channel` is taken into account.
> If `collection` and `video` are supplied, the player will play the videos in the collection starting from the video that was specified.
> If the collection doesn't contain the video, the player will remain black (despite the docs saying that collection will play regardless).

## FAQ

* **Which should I choose, `TwitchEmbed` or `TwitchPlayer`?**
> They're both very similar, however, if you need to embed a stream with its chat and don't plan on controlling the player object
> from outside, then `TwitchEmbed` should be fine. The key difference is that `TwitchPlayer` not only accepts VODs and collections,
> it also has access to a more complete player object. Also, switching channels in `TwitchPlayer` is more fluid because it uses the
> player API to switch the channel. This also happens on `TwitchEmbed` but only when `withChat` is set to `false`. If `withChat` is
> set to `true` o `TwitchEmbed` and the `channel` prop is updated, it will recreate the embed. Another key difference is that `TwitchEmbed`
> will download the Twitch Embed and Player scripts. When multiple Embeds are mounted in the same page, the Player script will be downloaded
> for each `TwitchEmbed` on the page. `TwitchPlayer` will only download it once.

* **Why is there `TwitchClip` and `TwitchPlayer`?**
> Twitch handles clips and VODs differently, this is also true for their embeds. `TwitchClip` will only work for clips whereas
> `TwitchPlayer` will work for VODs, collections and streams.

* **Why are there multiple `404` errors in my console?**
> Twitch is currently undergoing an API migration and the embeds still use the old API which is already deprecated. The embeds still
> work fine.

* **Why are my embeds sticking next to each other?**
> If you need multiple embeds of the same type on the same page, you need to supply an `id` prop to each one, otherwise the embeds
> will mount on the same node, making them stick to each other.

* **Why are the `parent` props no longer required for `TwitchChat` and `TwitchClip`?**
> When I first implemented the Twitch Embed updates, I didn't think too much of the usage of these components. I overlooked how easy it was to just
> add the domain URL of the site that is embedding these components into the parent parameter of the iframe URLs.

* **My embeds don't work, they just show an error JSON body.**
> Make sure that the you're specifying the `parent` prop for `TwitchChat` and `TwitchClip` and that your site is running in **HTTPS**.

* **Is there a demo?**
> Not yet, once I get enough time, I'll make a demo page.

## Example usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { TwitchEmbed, TwitchChat, TwitchClip, TwitchPlayer } from 'react-twitch-embed';

const Stream = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <TwitchEmbed
        channel="moonstar_x"
        id="moonstar_x"
        theme="dark"
        muted
        onVideoPause={() => console.log(':(')}
      />
      <TwitchChat channel="moonstar_x" theme="dark" />
      <TwitchClip clip="WealthyBumblingKimchiItsBoshyTime" parent={['mycoolsite.com, anotherawesomesite.net']} />
      <TwitchPlayer video="333014765" />
    </div>
  );
}
```
